# Handwritten Digit Identifier

In 3B1B's Neural Network Series, the legendary Professor Sanderson teaches us the basics of NNs using a simple handwritten digit identifier. 

Here I try to follow along and make it with just Python and Numpy (consider numpy part of vanilla python).

My use of ReLU and Softmax activation functions are necessary to make this grandiose neural network more efficient and effective such that you and I may identify digits better.
