# Handwritten Digit Identifier

In 3B1B's Neural Network Series, legendary Professor Sanderson teaches us the basics of NNs using a simple handwritten digit identifier. 

Here I try to follow along and make it with just Python and Numpy (consider numpy part of vanilla python).

Known as the "Hello World" of NNs, my use of ReLU and Softmax activation functions are absolutely necessary to make it more efficient and effective such that you and I may identify digits better.
